        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>
            At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elements consist of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tag name</li>
            <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p>
            CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. It can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
        </p>
        <p>
CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
</p>
<p>
For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:

        </p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex functionalities on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more—you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
            </p>
            <p>
            The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Store useful values inside variables</li>
                <li>Perform operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming)</li>
                    <li>Run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page - for example, a user clicking a button</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="script.png">
            What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.
            
            APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.
